My name is William Nathaniel Evans, but I go by Nate as a nickname. I enrolled into KY Code because I am interested in pursing a path in some type of IT space. Currently, I am working full time as a QuicKBooks customer service tech. I first started with Intuit in 2020 as a T1 agent taking phone calls for various issues within QBDT. During this time I got bumped up to being a Tier 2, where I basically worked with our T1 agents as they was taking phone calls. I also helped with customer complaints and escalated issues according to procedures. I then got bumped up to another position by June of 2023, working for Intuits Office of the President, in where I am also tied in with Triage and in a supportability/Tier 3 role and have been here ever since. On the side I have two beautiful daughters that are turning 2 years old this year and I love sitting up during the nights and messing with my gaming PC while also gaming. :)
